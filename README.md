# Something Awesome - CTFs

CTFs are competitions where participants try to uncover a â€˜flagâ€™ value hidden in a system that they need to hack into.

### Proposal:

I have been wanting to challenge myself with building up a broad toolkit of security skills, diving into CTFs and developing my attackerâ€™s mindset by working through practical puzzles that also mimic real instances of exploitation and security vulnerabilities in the past.

For my 'Something Awesome' project, I plan to:

1. Pick up the basics and produce beginner-friendly learning resources/guides/technical blogs.
    - Cryptography
        - Encryption schemes
        - RSA
    - Web exploitation
        - SQLI
        - XSS
        - Server-side request forgery (SSRF)
        - Client-side request forgery (CSRF)
    - Binary exploitation
        - Registers
        - Endianness
        - Format String Vulnerability
        - Buffer overflow
    - Reverse engineering
        - Disassemblers
        - Decompilers
    - Forensics
        - Steganography
        - Wireshark
    - Misc
        - Text encoding

    I will document my progress through technical blogs which will focus on providing a beginnerâ€™s guide to understanding concepts and tools within each of the above topics. These will be written with a target audience that has a basic computer science background but very little background in security.

2. Participate in a number of CTFs
    - Produce my own written solutions and reasoning/discussion around the problem solving strategy for solving CTF problems I encounter.
3. Develop and deploy a personal blog site where I will upload the technical blogs I write over the term.
    - This will likely be on my existing React portfolio site, or another hosting service like GitHub pages.
    Note: Alternatively, I may publish them to Medium.

### Criteria:

#### PS:

- Produce at least 1 technical blog for each of the main CTF topics (cryptography, web exploitation, binary exploitation, reverse engineering, forensics)
- Participate in at least 1 CTF and document the problem-solving strategies used in each competitionâ€™s questions.

#### CR:

- Produce technical blogs for all topics & concepts outlined in part 1 of the plan above.
- Participate in at least 2 CTFs and document the problem-solving strategies used in each competitionâ€™s questions.

#### DN:

- Produce technical blogs for all topics & concepts outlined in part 1 of the plan above, and a few more other related concepts within the main CTF topics.
- Deploy some technical blogs to a public website or personal blog site.
- Participate in at least 3 CTFs and document the problem-solving strategies used in each competitionâ€™s questions.

#### HD:

- Produce technical blogs for all topics & concepts outlined in part 1 of the plan above, and several more other related concepts within the main CTF topics.
- Deploy all technical blogs to a public website or personal blog site.
- Participate in at least 4 CTFs, and document the problem-solving strategies used in each competitionâ€™s questions.

### Additional Goals:

These are just personal stretch goals that would improve the reading experience for technical blogs I write:

If deploying blogs on my own portfolio site:
- Produce a lo-fi Figma prototype for the technical blog subpages to illustrate the concept and guide development.
- The site should intuitively group together related blogs and logically order them. Having at least this would help the reader organise their knowledge a little better than if they were to just follow a flat list of articles like you see on Medium and other blogging sites.
- Design a cool hackerâ€™s theme for the frontend ðŸ˜Ž

### Backup Project:

Develop an interactive hacking web app that provides the users with guided challenges touching on all major topics required in CTFs (cryptography, web exploitation, binary exploitation, reverse engineering, forensics).
